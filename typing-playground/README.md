# Typing Playground

I'm enthusiast of mechanical keyboards, building, changing switches, swapping keycaps and just customizing tool that I use everyday is a fun for me. Improving typing experience increases joy of writing (code).

I like to type for sheer fun of it and I like to test myself for speed. I'm using [monkeytype](https://www.monkeytype.com) to take rapid test to stretch my fingers or just to get focused.

## Requirements

For this little project I'd like to create simple copy of typetesting where you can take test for two time spans (15 and 30 seconds), change font, keep your local leaderboard, display keyboard (one layout) and highlight typed letters on that displayed keyboard. I'd like to also implement moving caret.

## Technology stack

* Design: Figma,
* Fonts: TBD,
* Language: JS,
* UI framework: TBD (None or Svelte),
* CSS: Vanilla CSS or TailwindCSS

I won't be making any API calls and heavy frontend stuff. I'm considering using vanilla JS or Svelte (because I've never used it and it seems like nice thing for small websites, at least I perceive it in that way).
